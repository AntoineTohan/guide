  <summary>Some blocks are red when I try to create a workflow</summary>
  
  If you see red blocks like the following screenshot, this means that you don't have right to use these blocks.

  Check your contract to see if the dates and tools should be available.

  Contact an administrator at `support@videomenthe.fr` if the blocks should be available.
